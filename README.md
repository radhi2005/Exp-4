# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## AIM:
To study the problem statement and SRS of a Hospital Management System and represent its system architecture using UML diagrams.

## SRS (Procedure):
```
Analyze the Hospital Management System and model its components through the following UML diagrams:

1.Use Case Diagram – Identifies actors (e.g., Doctor, Patient, Receptionist) and system functionalities (e.g., Schedule Appointment, Admit Patient, Generate Bill).
2.Class Diagram – Represents classes such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Billing, and their relationships.
3.Activity Diagram – Describes workflows like patient admission and discharge.
4.Sequence Diagram – Illustrates time-based interactions during tasks such as booking an appointment.
5.Communication Diagram – Highlights communication between system components like Receptionist, Doctor, and Medical Records.
6.Package Diagram – Organizes components into modules such as Patient Management, Billing, and Scheduling.
